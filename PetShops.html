  <h3> Pet shops are retail businesses that sell different animals to the public, as well as other supplies and pet accessories and necessities. Not many people are aware of how these businesses get their puppies. Additionally, conditions in pet shops are not always the best. </h3>
</p>
<div>
  <strong> Terrible conditions at pet shops include: </strong>
</div>
<div>
  - Small wire bottom cages in which multiple puppies are put together, having little to no space.
</div>
<div>
  - Puppies are put in glass cages so people from outside can see them, but the blaring hot sun overheats innocent puppies.
</div>
<div>
  - No human interaction.
</div>
- Many puppies are sick, but not treated due to lack of care.
<div>
- Dogs are overpriced.
</div>
<div>
- Pet shops are usually very dirty which contributes to dog illness.
</div>
<div>
  - Puppies often have psychological problems which go unnoticed.
</div>

  <strong> Over 90 percent of puppies at pet shops come from puppy mills. Puppy mills are large scale dog breeding operations in which profit is prioritized over the well-being of the animal itself. At 8 weeks young, puppies are ripped away from their mothers. Out of these 10,000 mills that exist in the United States, less than half (2,024) are USDA licensed. Over 2.15 million puppies are sold from puppy mills. </strong>
</p>
<div>
  <strong> Problems with puppy mills: </strong>
</div>
<div>
  - Puppies at puppy mills receive almost no veterinary care, so many illnesses will go unnoticed or uncared for.
</div>
<div>
  - Mother dogs are given almost no recovery time in between litters are often times will be killed once they can no longer produce.
</div>
<div>
  - Dogs are housed in small, dirty, overcrowded cages without proper nutrients or care. Many dogs are not provided with fresh water or air.
</div>
<div>
  - Some cages are left outside without protection from the elements, especially those that are harsh.
</div>
<div>
  - Dogs suffer from neglect because they are not provided with affection or care.
</div>
<div>
  - Many dogs at puppy mills are underweight due to lack of nutritional support.
</div>
<div>
  - Puppies who come from puppy mills suffer from psychological and physical problems which affect both the dog and owner when it comes to proper veterinary care and expenses.
