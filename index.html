  <strong> OUR MISSION: </strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are all dog lovers who are saddened about the way animals are treated in certain pet shops and the fact that over 90 percent of puppies at pet shops come from puppy mills. Puppy mills are detrimental to the health and wellbeing of dogs. These are unnecessary due to the millions of dogs at shelters waiting to find a loving home. Our ultimate goal is to inform people about this while also letting them know that some shelters euthanize their animals after a while and some do not so that when adopting, they will consider saving those dogs that may be killed soon enough. In addition, we want to inform people on different stigmas surrounding specific breeds of dogs that are false so that when looking for a new dog, they will not hold back on a certain breed because of those false stigmas. We would like any people who are looking for a furry friend to consider adoption over a pet shop because purchasing a pet shop pet comes with risks as many dogs have psychological and physical problems and puppy mills continue to be funded through this.

  I’m a rising junior at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, New York. I am interested in liberal arts as well as veterinary medicine, due to my underlying love for animals. Over the years I have taken in hurt animals, such as birds, to allow for them to make a full recovery without the dangers of the outside. Though I rescued these animals, I returned them back outside eventually because that is the environment they need to develop properly. My permanent pet is a guinea pig named Mocha who I adopted when she was just a baby. My future goals are to foster a dog as I cannot adopt one yet, but would still like to provide a home as well as love and affection. My personal goal is to inspire people to go to shelters, rather than pet shops and save a life that desperately needs it.

    I’m a rising senior at North Shore Hebrew Academy High School in Great Neck. I am interested in math, history, and the sciences. In my free time, I enjoy a good ice cold cup of coffee, netflix, sleep, and reading. I’m still undecided about my future but I am leaning more towards the medicine, technology, and business. A few years ago, my family adopted two beautiful dogs from a shelter. A Siberian husky and a Minnie poodle. Animals have always brought joy to me. Dixie and Simba (the two dogs my family adopted) have been with me through the tough times. They’ve comforted me at times I didn’t know I needed it. It’s true when they say “ A dog is a man’s best friend”.

    I’m a rising senior at Bard High School Early College in Manhattan. Even though I want a career in math and economics, I believe computer science is necessary to adapt to the changing job market. I feel passionate about helping those in need, and animals are just one example. My family even adopted my cat during the winter when we discovered her outside rather than simply giving her to a shelter, so I hope to raise awareness for other homeless animals. My family, especially my mom, has grown to love the cat and could not imagine our family without her. I hope others have the chance to experience life with a pet who will inevitably become another member of your household.
