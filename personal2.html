 <h3> Each animal has a story. These stories discuss some events that lead certain animals to find a home and finally become a part of a family through adoption from shelters. Many assume that shelter animals are untrained and mean; however, through these stories, it’s clear that these animals grow to love their owners and help them immensely. Animal lovers who aren’t exactly ready to adopt their own pet sometimes choose to foster one. Fostering is a great way to have contact with animals without assuming responsibility for them for the rest of their lives. However, the connections people form with their temporary pet can blossom into something greater, and they would adopt the animal because they can’t imagine their lives without it.  </h3>

  “When Bear the pit bull was still just a puppy, he was hit by a car at a gas station and left for dead. The accident led him to lose both of his eyes, and when his owner saw him at the hospital, she just left them there. Luckily, a member of the hospital staff named Sarah, welcomed them into their home and their hearts, and now he’s the happiest pup ever. “Light can never be drowned out of a dog’s world. Dogs can be put through horrible things, but they still can bounce back and live a happy life. It’s that ability to leave the past in the past that make dogs so amazing.” his Facebook page reads.”

  “This is my boy Wesson. The top picture is the day after Stray Rescue of St. Louis found him bleeding and shaking from fear in an animal control cage. When a Stray Rescue staff member saw him at animal control she called the founder of Stray Rescue and immediately had him moved over to their facility for medical care. They discovered he had been shot in his back and had bullet fragments still inside him. They performed surgery on him to remove the fragments. Today he is good as new and happy in his forever home with me.” — Liz McKibben

  “Pacino was brought in to my animal hospital to be euthanized for being “too aggressive” after he was used as a bait dog in Camden. I decided to rescue him because when I met him that day he licked my face & I knew he was an angel. He had extensive surgery and I took him home looking like the left picture. About 1 year later on the right, he is my pride and joy and the sweetest couch potato I know. He loves dressing up and showing off his handsome face!! His story is proof that Pit Bulls are, in fact, born inherently good.” — Brittany Elder

<h4> Story #4 </h4>
<p>
  One day, while at the shelter, a couple were asked to help a new dog, Wiggie,  who had been rescued from the Central Valley. He was in despair. He wouldn’t eat, play, or move. He had suffered from distemper when he was a puppy and as a result, he had a constant facial twitch. The family agreed to foster him. For weeks, the couple and their seven-year old son tended to his every need. They fed him, gave him his medicine, slowly walked him, snuggled him, and held him close at night. Slowly but surely their foster dog learned to trust and to listen to the hardships of their son, Tye. It became clear that Wiggie and Ty needed to stay together. No matter how hard they tried, the world was a lonely place for their son until Wiggie came along. He quite simply changed everything. They fell so in love with the dog that it eventually became a permanent part of their family through adoption.

“Fostering a dog—taking a dog into your home and providing it with shelter and care for a predetermined amount of time or until a forever home is found—is one of the most rewarding things a dog person can do. I admit, I’m a little biased: I fostered for years (and want to do so again when my living situation allows), and it was one of the best experiences of my life”
“Of course, fostering comes with one big hazard that can also be one of its biggest rewards: you just might fall in love! ‘Foster failures’ abound in the dog rescue world, and I know because I am one myself: my dog Radar was supposed to be a temporary foster dog, but I soon realized I couldn’t imagine him belonging to anyone but me.”

<h4> Story #6 </h4>
<p>
  “Sheldon “Ski” Kobylanski, of nearby Laveen, is one of the shelter’s most prolific foster parents. Although he has four dogs of his own, since 2010 he’s brought more than 100 other animals to stay at his home he calls a Disneyland for dogs,” where they paddle freely in the backyard pool.
His voice breaks as he recalls some of the pups that have passed through his doggie doors: Lana, a pit bull puppy with a broken leg (“I’ll never forget her face.”); Eggbert, a Chihuahua so tiny he fit in Kobylanski’s palm; Bruno, an emaciated pit bull he nursed through the potentially deadly canine parvovirus; and Zeus, a pit bull mix whose aggressive cancer diagnosis broke Kobylanski’s heart. And so many more. With pet adoption you save only one dog, Kobylanski says, but fostering provides a chance to save many dogs every year. All it takes is time, space and love. “If you can expand the walls of the shelter by providing love, a safe place and a warm bed for an animal — any animal — you can be a foster parent,” he says.”
