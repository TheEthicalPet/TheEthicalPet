  <h3>An animal shelter is a place where stray animals, usually cats and dogs, are provided with all of the necessities to survive. From shelters, people can adopt and give these innocent animals a home. There are different variations of animal shelters, and in some animals are treated cruelly until they are finally adopted or euthanized.</h3>

<strong>  No-Kill Shelters: </strong>
<div>
A no-kill shelter is the most humane shelter by far. Animals are provided with care no matter how full the shelter becomes. These animals are not euthanized in order to introduce space for  new, younger animals. However, these shelters quickly become overcrowded if animals are not adopted at a steady pace, so there is a limited number of animals that can be accepted.

<strong>  Kill Shelters: </strong>
<div>
A kill shelter is a shelter that euthanizes animals in order to prevent overcrowding and create space for new, younger animals that are more likely to be adopted. More than 10% of the animals in these shelters are euthanized.
</div>
<p>
Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats). However, the number of dogs and cats euthanized in U.S. shelters annually has declined from approximately 2.6 million in 2011, which can be contributed to an increase in adoptions from shelters and the return of lost animals.
